#include<stdio.h>
/* This is my C program
	and btw, this comments do not affect
	the executeable in any way!
*/
// This also does the trick, but its a one line inhibitor. */ works multiline and must be closed. if it's two lines long it really isnt cos its just a page thing.

main() 
{
 printf("Hello, This is my first c program. \n");
 return 0;
}
